#summary development of the ORR-enabled SensorML/TEDS generator

Test: http://mmisw.org/smlmor/  (for current status, see below)

= Introduction =

This page documents the specification, requirements, and development of the [http://mmisw.org/orr/ ORR-enabled] SensorML/TEDS generator. For lack of a better name, the tool is currently codenamed 'sml-mor' (a combination of SensorML and MMI Ontology Registry and repository).


= Goal =

The overall goal of this tool is to facilitate the creation of formal documents (SensorML or TEDS, in principle) describing an observing system (system type, variables, ..) out from a set of definitions provided by the user in a web-based graphical user interface.

= Description =

The initial version captures the specification of systems and variables (with unbounded nesting of systems) and generates the corresponding SensorML document based on an intermediate OOSTethys model instantiation of the spec given by the user.

The integration with http://mmisw.org/orr/ ORR] --to help in the specification of system types and variables-- is not yet addressed but here are possible general approaches:

  * Include a drop-down list for each field. This may not be as simple; in general, the user would actually do some form of search in order to identify the term, definition, or URI that is appropriate for the field.  

  * A more sophisticated approach would be some kind of wizard (sequence of step) involving the look-up of terms and relationships in the MMI ORR for a complete section is the GUI.


= Summary of tool status =


2009-10-14 0.0.2pre
  * interface improved based on tabpanels
  * http://mmisw.org/smlmor/?_log=y generates a tree dump for testing and comparison. The generated SensorML seems to be missing some settings to properly specify systems and variables.

2009-10-12 first version, 0.0.1
  * generates SensorML (see [http://code.google.com/p/oostethys/source/browse/trunk/component/client/java/oostethys-java-smlmor/ChangeLog.txt ChangeLog]).
  * No yet integration with ORR
