Perl Module Installation Tips

Tips for installing the required XML::LibXML and XML::LibXML::XPathContext Perl modules on various systems.
Two Perl Modules are required:

   1. XML::LibMXL
   2. XML:::LibXML::XPathContext

Installing XML::LibXML
The oostethys_sos CGI script relies on the existence of libxml2 and it's Perl module interface XML::LibXML. It also relies on the CGI.pm perl module, but that is a fairly common module usually included with the basic Perl installation.
Red Hat Linux

Perl Module on CPAN

Libxml2 C libary downloads.
http://xmlsoft.org/  
 
Typical CPAN install
   perl -MCPAN -e 'shell'
That dumps you to a shell prompt like:
shell> install XML::LibXML
which should take care of fetching, configuring dependencies, etc.

If this fails, you will probably need to install libxml2 and libxml2-devel. on
redhat (and I believe also Debian?) there are separate packages for binaries
and header files. that is, if you want the stuff in /usr/include, which you
need for building software on top of any given package, then you generally
need to install the -devel package as well...
Libxml2 tar balls and RPM's

Installing XML::LibXML::XPathContext

Perl Module on CPAN
Download: http://search.cpan.org/~pajas/XML-LibXML-XPathContext-0.07/
Documentation: http://search.cpan.org/~pajas/XML-LibXML-XPathContext-0.07/XPathContext.pm

 
Typical CPAN install

   perl -MCPAN -e 'shell'

That dumps you to a shell prompt like:

shell> install XML::LibXML::XPathContext

which should take care of fetching, configuring dependencies, etc.
