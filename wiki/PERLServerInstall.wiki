= Installing the OOSTethys PERL SOS as an Apache CGI program =

= File List =
    * oostethys_sos.cgi  -  the CGI script
    * sos_config.xml - empty configuration file.
    * example_sos_config.xml -  An example config file using values from GoMOOS
    * sosGetCapabilities.xml - 1.0 template
    * sosGetObservation.xml - 1.0 template
    * sosDescribeSystem.xml - 1.0 template
    * difGetCapabilities.xml - DIF template
    * difGetObservation.xml - DIF template
    * difDescribeSystem.xml - DIF template


= Installation Steps =

  # Put the oostethys_sos.cgi script into your cgi-bin directory and make sure it has execute permission.  Typically this in  the /cgi-bin/ directory of you Web server.  At GoMOOS I installed it in a subdirectory  /cgi-bin/sos/  (Note:  If you are ftp'ing from a PC to your server or using a tool such as DreamWeaver to move the files to you Web server make sure that the script is transferred using binary mode)

 # Put the six XML template files in the same directory

    * sosGetCapabilities.xml
    * sosGetObservation.xml
    * sosDescribeSystem.xml
    * difGetCapabilities.xml
    * difGetObservation.xml
    * difDescribeSystem.xml

 # Put the sos_config.xml file in the same directory.

 # Test the server. See if your GetCapabilities request is working.  http://localhost/cgi-bin/oostethy_sos.cgi?request=GetCapabilities&service=SOS&version=1.0.0

  GetCapbilties should return XML. Not a very interesting response since the sos_config.xml has null values.
