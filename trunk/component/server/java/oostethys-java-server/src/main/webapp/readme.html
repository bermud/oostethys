<h2>About OOSTethys</h2>
<p>Thank you for downloading and trying OOSTethys toolkits.</p>
<p>

OOSTethys is an open source collaborative project that seeks to create and adapt tools to help developing observing system components. Observing system components span form sensor interfaces to catalogs of services. OOSTethys team seeks the best standards available and creates easy to adopt toolkits. The toolkits should :
   <ul>
	<li>  dramatically reduce the time  service providers  spend installing, adopting and keeping up to date new technologies and standard services.</li>
	<li>    increase interoperability since the toolkits are standard reference implementation and relies on the best practices of the community.</li>
</ul>

<h2> JAVA Toolkit <i>Version: 0.3.9_20090916</i></h2>
<p>The OOSTethys JAVA Toolkit creates an OGC-compliant Sensor Observation Service <a
	href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/sensorweb">
(SOS)</a> from sources that could be read by the UNIDATA <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf-java/">NetCDF Java API</a>. Sources include NetCDF files and OpenDAP servers.</p>

<p>Setting up a server is very easy. You download a zip file, which contains a war file. The war file is copied in your web application server (e.g. Tomcat). You open a configuration file which details the metadata about the server, NetCDF or OpenDAP URL as well as the name of the variables you want to include in the SOS service. And that’s all. Detail step by step process is found in the <a href="instructions.html">instructions</a> page.</p>
