#summary PERL Server Installation Notes
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Installing the OOSTethys PERL SOS as an Apache CGI program =

= File List =
  * oostethys_sos.cgi  -  the CGI script
  * sos_config.xml - empty configuration file.
  * example_sos_config.xml -  An example config file using values from GoMOOS
  * sosGetCapabilities.xml - 1.0 template
  * sosGetObservation.xml - 1.0 template
  * sosDescribeSystem.xml - 1.0 template
  * difGetCapabilities.xml - DIF template
  * difGetObservation.xml - DIF template
  * difDescribeSystem.xml - DIF template


== Installation Steps ==

  # Put the oostethys_sos.cgi script into your cgi-bin directory and make sure it has execute permission.  Typically this in  the /cgi-bin/ directory of you Web server.  At GoMOOS I installed it in a subdirectory  /cgi-bin/sos/  (Note:  If you are ftp'ing from a PC to your server or using a tool such as DreamWeaver to move the files to you Web server make sure that the script is transferred using binary mode)
  # Put the six XML template files in the same directory
     * sosGetCapabilities.xml
     * sosGetObservation.xml
     * sosDescribeSystem.xml
     * difGetCapabilities.xml
     * difGetObservation.xml
     * difDescribeSystem.xml
  # Put the sos_config.xml file in the same directory.
  # Test the server. See if your GetCapabilities request is working.  http://localhost/cgi-bin/oostethy_sos.cgi?request=GetCapabilities&service=SOS&version=1.0.0 GetCapbilties should return XML. Not a very interesting response since the sos_config.xml has null values.

== Required PERL Modules ==
Two Perl Modules are required:
  # XML::LibMXL
  # XML:::LibXML::XPathContext

=== Perl Module Installation Tips ===

Installing XML::LibXML
The oostethys_sos CGI script relies on the existence of libxml2 and it's Perl module interface XML::LibXML. It also relies on the CGI.pm perl module, but that is a fairly common module usually included with the basic Perl installation.
Red Hat Linux

Perl Module on CPAN
http://search.cpan.org/dist/XML-LibXML/

Libxml2 C libary downloads.
http://xmlsoft.org/  
 
Typical CPAN install
   perl -MCPAN -e 'shell'
That dumps you to a shell prompt like:
shell> install XML::LibXML
which should take care of fetching, configuring dependencies, etc.

If this fails, you will probably need to install libxml2 and libxml2-devel. on
redhat (and I believe also Debian?) there are separate packages for binaries
and header files. that is, if you want the stuff in /usr/include, which you
need for building software on top of any given package, then you generally
need to install the -devel package as well...
Libxml2 tar balls and RPM's

Installing XML::LibXML::XPathContext

Perl Module on CPAN
Download: http://search.cpan.org/~pajas/XML-LibXML-XPathContext-0.07/
Documentation: http://search.cpan.org/~pajas/XML-LibXML-XPathContext-0.07/XPathContext.pm

 
Typical CPAN install

   perl -MCPAN -e 'shell'

That dumps you to a shell prompt like:

shell> install XML::LibXML::XPathContext

which should take care of fetching, configuring dependencies, etc.
