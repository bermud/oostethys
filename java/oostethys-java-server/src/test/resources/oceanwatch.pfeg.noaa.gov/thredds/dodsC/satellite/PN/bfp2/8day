<h3>OPeNDAP Server Help</h3>
To access most of the features of this OPeNDAP server, append
one of the following a eight suffixes to a URL: .das, .dds, .dods, .ddx, .blob, .info,
.ver or .help. Using these suffixes, you can ask this server for:
<dl>
<dt> das  </dt> <dd> Dataset Attribute Structure (DAS)</dd>
<dt> dds  </dt> <dd> Dataset Descriptor Structure (DDS)</dd>
<dt> dods </dt> <dd> DataDDS object (A constrained DDS populated with data)</dd>
<dt> ddx  </dt> <dd> XML version of the DDS/DAS</dd>
<dt> blob </dt> <dd> Serialized binary data content for requested data set, with the constraint expression applied.</dd>
<dt> info </dt> <dd> info object (attributes, types and other information)</dd>
<dt> html </dt> <dd> html form for this dataset</dd>
<dt> ver  </dt> <dd> return the version number of the server</dd>
<dt> help </dt> <dd> help information (this text)</dd>
</dl>
For example, to request the DAS object from the FNOC1 dataset at URI/GSO (a
test dataset) you would appand `.das' to the URL:
http://opendap.gso.uri.edu/cgi-bin/nph-nc/data/fnoc1.nc.das.
<p><b>Note</b>: Many OPeNDAP clients supply these extensions for you so you don't
need to append them (for example when using interfaces supplied by us or
software re-linked with a OPeNDAP client-library). Generally, you only need to
add these if you are typing a URL directly into a WWW browser.
<p><b>Note</b>: If you would like version information for this server but
don't know a specific data file or data set name, use `/version' for the
filename. For example: http://opendap.gso.uri.edu/cgi-bin/nph-nc/version will
return the version number for the netCDF server used in the first example. 
<p><b>Suggestion</b>: If you're typing this URL into a WWW browser and
would like information about the dataset, use the `.info' extension.
<p>If you'd like to see a data values, use the `.html' extension and submit a
query using the customized form.
