===========
Describption:
A javascript only OGC SOS GetCapabilities and GetObservation XML response parsers.
There are two modules: jquery.parseSOSGetCap.js and jquery.parseSOSGetObs.js both of which require
JQuery to parse OGC Sensor Observation Service GetCapabilities response XML with both default namespace and non.
E.g. <Capabilities> and <sos:Capabilities>
Both modules can be used together.

===========
These are aimed at the SOS servers being developed by the NOAA / IOOS program  http://www.ioos.gov/.
There is support for both IOOS DIF and OOSTethys SWE1.0 type responses.
===========

Documenentation files and examples are included.
Open index.html in browser to get started.
There are example html files which exercise both modules and are included here. Some example SOS xml files are also included.

Requirements:  jQuery 1.5 http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.5.min.js
Tested with:  jQuery 1.6 http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.6.min.js
Updated Fed. 2012 and tested with jQuery 1.7.1 http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.1.min.js
jQuery 1.7 dropped support for find("[nodeName='xxx:element_name']") so a new plugin function was defined.
filterNode('xxx:element_name')
Backward compatibility was maintained.  XML processing performance was greatly enhanced.
