SOS Server CGI PERL Toolkit
by Eric Bridger last modified Sept. 20, 2009

File List
    * oostethys_sos.cgi  -  the CGI script
    * sos_config.xml - empty configuration file.
    * example_sos_config.xml -  An example config file using values from GoMOOS
    * sosGetCapabilities.xml - 1.0 template
    * sosGetObservation.xml - 1.0 template
    * sosDescribeSystem.xml - 1.0 template
    * difGetCapabilities.xml - DIF template
    * difGetObservation.xml - DIF template
    * difDescribeSystem.xml - DIF template

Installation Steps
1. Put the oostethys_sos.cgi script into your cgi-bin directory and make sure it has execute permission.  Typically this in  the /cgi-bin/ directory of you Web server.  At GoMOOS I installed it in a subdirectory  /cgi-bin/sos/  (Note:  If you are ftp'ing from a PC to your server or using a tool such as DreamWeaver to move the files to you Web server make sure that the script is transferred using binary mode)
2. Put the sic XML template files in the same directory
    1. sosGetCapabilities.xml
    2. sosGetObservation.xml
    3. sosDescribeSystem.xml
    4. difGetCapabilities.xml
    5. difGetObservation.xml
    6. difDescribeSystem.xml
3. Put the sos_config.xml file in the same directory.

4. See if you GetCapabilities request is working.  http://localhost/cgi-bin/oostethy_sos.cgi?request=GetCapabilities&service=SOS&version=1.0.0

GetCapbilties should return XML. Not very interesting response since the sos_config.xml has null values.

See UPGRADES, INSTALL_MODULES, INSTALL_ASCII or INSTALL_RDBS in the docs/ subdirectory for addtional instructions.
